# Bot Updater
A little program I wrote to update a discord bots avatar and name, this was build because of the recient bug where you cannot modify these in the discord api dashboard.

## Usage
It is verry simple, simply open `index.ts` and fill in the fields. Add your avatar to this folder if necessary.

Then run the following commands:
> `npm run build`
> `npm run start`
